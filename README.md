# Unlearning Optimization Methods Comparison

This project compares three optimization methods for machine unlearning in logistic regression:
- Newton Update
- L-BFGS
- Gradient Descent (GD)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd unlearning_experiments

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create a results/ directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir results
4. Run Experiments
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python run_experiment.py
